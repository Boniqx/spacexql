This is a simple react app to test my graphql knowledge. 
I used react version 17.0.2.
I used the link: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ for my GraphQL endpoint
I kind of like Elon Musk and his accomplishments and it's also one of the example links you've given.

I was thinking to be fancy to add carousels, searching and other stuffs but you only required it to be small and not to have a lot of features.

To run:
npm install
npm run start

(if ever there are no styles please run: npx tailwindcss-cli@latest init)
